There are no default variables, so the scope is for you and your imagination to figure out.

### example
```javascript
  vars: {
    foo: 'bar',
    steps: 10,
    strings: 'Some variable string',
    adding: 1 + 9 + 11,
    objects: {
      key: 'key value'
    },
    arrays: [
      'value 1',
      'value 2',
    ]
  }
```

## listeners
Listeners are what you setup that allow your Deva to communicate with other Deva or parts of your application/system.

```javascript
this.listeners
```

### default

Each Deva comes with a set of default listeners to provide basic functionality.

### start
This will trigger an event to start the Deva.

```javascript
this.talk(`*agent_key*:start`);
```

### stop
This will trigger an event to stop the Deva.

```javascript
this.talk(`*agent_key*:stop`);
```

### status
This will trigger an event to broadcast the Deva status.

```javascript
this.talk(`*agent_key*:status`);
```

## devas

```javascript
this.devas
```

The main object for Deva that are bwlow this Deva.

## modules

The external modules that your Deva might require to function.

```javascript
this.modules
```

## func
The functions that your deva uses to operate. Functions are not exposed through
the api to public access.

```javascript
this.func
```

### methods
```javascript
this.methods
```

The methods are exposed publicly through the question event that parses a string
and sends a request to the question method that then interacts with functions, modules, and variables.

## states
Provided are a set of state functions that trigger when a Deva is at various states of starting/stopping.

### onStart()

The `onStart()` function runs after the `start` function has completed.

```javascript
this.onStart() {
  // some code to run when the deva starts.
}
```

### onStop()

The `onStop()` function runs after the `stop` function has completed.

```javascript
this.onStop() {
  // some code to run when the deva stops
}
```

### onEnter()

The `onEnter()` function runs after the `enter` event has fired.

```javascript
this.onEnter() {
  // some code to run when the deva is loaded
}
```

### onExit()

The `onExit()`function runs after the `exit` event has fired.

```javascript
this.onExit() {
  // some code to run when the deva logs out.
}
```

### onDone()

The `onDone()`function runs after the `done` event has fired.

```javascript
this.onDone() {
  // some code to run when the deva logs out.
}
```

### onInit()

The `onInit()` function runs after the `init()` function has completed.

```javascript
this.onInit() {
  // some code to run when the Deva initializes.
}
```

## utility

### question

The question event is the functionality that exposes the methods to the outside world. When a deva asks a question the string is parsed into a question format so that commands to access various methods can be exposed.

The `question(packet)` function is a default function that allows the system to ask questions of itself or other Deva.

The function checks the beginning of a string for a `#` to determine wether to issue a command to run a specific method.

See [Question Listener](#question) for usage.


```javascript
// async await
const question = await this.question('#*agent_key* *method*:*params* *question string*');

// promises
this.question('#*agent_key* *method*:*params* *question string*').then(response => {
  ...
}).catch(err => {
  ...
})
```

### uid()
Generates a unique ID that is used in packet transfer and other various ways.

```javascript
this.uid() // inside the object

// example
this.vars.id = this.uid()

```

### talk(evt, resource=false)

The `talk()` function is used when your Deva needs to broadcast an event that other Deva
or functions would be listening for.

```javascript
this.talk('event', resource);  // inside the object
deva.talk('event', resource); // outside the object

// example
const evt_id = this.uid();
const evt_data = {
  task_id: 1,
  task_name: 'this is blank data',
  task_contact: 'joe@schmo.com',
};

this.talk('big-event', {
  id: evt_id,
  key: this.me.key,
  q: {
    bot: this.me,
    text: 'text to send to the event',
    data: evt_data,
  },
  created: Date.now(),
});
```

### listen(evt callback)

The `listen` function can assign listeners to the Deva and designate which `callback`
function to run when an event is fired.

Listeners can be set up individually this way or also added to the listeners object
independently.

```javascript
this.listen('some-event', this.func.listener);

this.func.listenter = packet => {
  console.log('some-event-fired');
};

```

### once(evt, callback)

The `once()` function can assign a one-time listener to a function. This is useful when returning data with an id that one Deva has submitted to another Deva. Also very useful for submit responses that are unique to the request.

```javascript
this.once(`some-once-event`, this.func.listener)
this.func.listener = packet => {
  console.log('some-once-event-fired');
}

```

### ignore(evt, callback)

The `ignore()` function removes a listener from the designated event. This is useful for adding and removing events dynamically or as needed.

```javascript
this.ignore('ignore-event', this.func.listener);
this.func.listener = packet => {
  console.log('ignore-event-fired');
}
```


### load(agent, opts)

To add a Deva dynamically use the `load()` function. This can be utilized to add Deva to an existing Deva after the object has already been created.

```javascript
const opts = {
  agent: {...},
  vars: {...},
  listeners: {...},
  deva: {...},
  func: {...},
  onStart() {},
  onStop() {},
  onEnter() {},
  onExit() {},
}
this.load('deva-name', opts);
```

### unload(agent)
To delete a Deva for any reason use `unload()`. This will delete the Deva and all it's parts from the current Deva.

```javascript

this.unload('deva-key');

```

### status()
The `status()` function will return the running status of the current Deva.

### start()
The `start()` function will start the Deva and run the `onStart()` state function.

### stop()
The `stop()` function will stop the Deva and run the `onStop()` state function.

### init(deva=false)
The `init()` function will initialize the Deva and run the `onInit()` state function.

### initDeva()
The `initDeva()` function will initialize the Deva located under the current Deva set. To be used in instances of a main Deva parent situation.
