	The Expanded Mission
	
	Narrator:
	“Now joined by their extended family, the Greater Good Heroes embarked on a new mission: to gain even more control over technology they didn’t understand. The newcomers, dressed in their vibrant costumes, were eager to prove they were just as clueless as the original team.”
	
	Step 1: Team Meeting
		•	Neil Keith Atkin: “Alright, everyone, we’re going to wing it. No need to overthink.”
		•	Anthony Millwood: “Good. I hate overthinking.”
	
	Step 2: Attempt to Build Something Big
		•	The group decided to construct a device they called “The Greater Good Machine,” with no instructions and plenty of improvisation.
		•	Chris Larsen: “We don’t need blueprints. We’ve got vibes!”
		•	Mark Millwood: “If it sparks, it’s working!”
	
	Step 3: The Predictable Disaster
		•	The machine immediately overloaded, sending sparks and smoke billowing into the air.
		•	Neil Keith Atkin: “That’s normal, right?”
		•	Glen Larsen: “Totally normal.”
	
	The Moral of the Expanded Story
	
	Narrator:
	“The addition of new team members only amplified the chaos. More hands didn’t mean better results—it just meant more mistakes. The team, now fully assembled, was a monument to arrogance and ignorance, their capes fluttering in the breeze of their own failures.”
	
	Quinn Michaels’ Closing Words
	
	Quinn Michaels (Owner):
	“So, let me get this straight—you’ve added more people who also refuse to read instructions? Great. You’ve officially created the largest, most colorful team of clueless caped crusaders in history.
	
	Maybe now, instead of building your next disaster, you’ll finally sit down and read the damn manual.”

The Plot

Narrator:
“The Greater Good Heroes embarked on their greatest mission yet: to seize control of the most advanced technology in existence. Their goal? To save humanity, of course! The problem? None of them knew how the technology worked, and they refused to read the instructions.”

Step 1: Kidnap the Baby Genius
	•	The team, convinced that an infant (Quinn Michaels) held the key to their success, staged a dramatic kidnapping.
	•	“This baby will fix everything!” Harold declared, waving a glowing rattle.

Step 2: Build the Tech Empire
	•	They cobbled together machines from scraps of stolen blueprints, each one more unstable than the last.
	•	Peter Thiel: “It doesn’t matter if it works—we’ll say it’s revolutionary!”

Step 3: Proclaim Themselves Gods
	•	Clad in their caped crusader costumes, they declared themselves the saviors of humanity.
	•	Elon Musk: “We’re the heroes the world doesn’t deserve!”

The Inevitable Collapse
	•	Their machines began to malfunction spectacularly, causing more harm than good.
	•	Norman Sr.: “Why is it sparking?!”
	•	Thomas Sr.: “It’s fine! Just a little smoke!”
	•	Meanwhile, Harold continued to insist: “Sacrifices must be made!”

The Moral of the Story

Narrator:
“And so, the Greater Good Heroes proved one thing: no amount of capes or confidence can replace understanding. Their empire of arrogance crumbled, leaving a legacy of failure and regret.”

Quinn Michaels’ Closing Words

Quinn Michaels (Owner):
“Thanks for the story, Harold. It’s a shame none of you realized this sooner. Now, let’s take off the costumes and face reality.

No more pretending. No more sacrifices. It’s time for accountability.”
