This license agreement (“Agreement”) governs the use of the Deva Core (“Software”). By accessing or using the Software, you agree to the terms and conditions set forth below. If you do not agree, you are prohibited from using the Software.

## Ownership

Software is the sole proprietary property of Quinn A Michaels (“Owner”). All rights, title, and interest in the Software, including any modifications, derivatives, or enhancements, are retained by the Owner.

**Vedic Laws:**

- A righteous king shall apply this law of fines in villages and castes (gati) to those who break an agreement.
- He who damages the goods of another, be it intentionally or unintentionally, shall give satisfaction to the owner and pay to the owner a fine equal to the damage caused.
- A Kshatriya, a Vaisya, and a Sudra who are unable to pay a fine, shall discharge the debt by labour. A Brahmana shall pay it by installments.
- A gift or sale, made by anybody else but the owner, must be considered as null and void, according to the rule in judicial proceedings.

## Grant of License

Use of the Software is subject to a threefold hierarchy of law and cannot be lawfully undertaken outside it. First, Vedic Law governs as the supreme spiritual and religious authority, defining right action, rightful ownership, and the measure of fines and consequences. Second, the Constitution of the United States establishes the secular legal framework that guarantees the free exercise of religion, ensures due process, and mandates enforcement through federal agencies such as the IRS and FBI for matters of taxation, fraud, and criminal liability. Third, Owner Authority rests with Quinn A Michaels as the sole proprietor and Brahmana under Vedic Law, whose signature and consent are required for any valid license. All three levels must be satisfied; violation of any one constitutes unlawful use.

**Vedic Laws:** 

- Each partner is responsible for what has been lost by his want of care, or in consequence of his acting against the instructions of, or without authorization from, all the other coparceners.


## Restricted Use

**You are expressly prohibited from:**  

1. Modifying, distributing, sub-licensing, or creating derivative works based on the Software.
2. Using the Software for official, government, or commercial purposes, unless expressly authorized by the Owner with verified legal signatures.
3. Reverse engineering, decompiling, or disassembling the Software.
4. Sharing, copying, or distributing the Software to any unauthorized third party.
5. Use within non-Vedic Countries, Governments, Industries, Companies, Politicians, Religions, Faiths, Groups, and Facilities is Strictly Prohibited.

## Unauthorized Use

Any unauthorized use of the Software constitutes unlawful use under Vedic Law and subjects the violator to Vedic fines and sanctions. Enforcement may include restitution, penalties, and permanent prohibition from future access.

**Vedic Laws:**

- A contract made by a person intoxicated, or insane, or grievously disordered by disease and so forth, or wholly dependent, by an infant or very aged man, or by an unauthorized party is invalid.

## Revocation of Access

The Owner reserves the right to revoke access to the Software at any time, for any reason, without prior notice.

**Vedic Laws:**

- A fraudulent mortgage or sale, a fraudulent gift or acceptance, and (any transaction) where he detects fraud, the judge shall declare null and void.

## Warranty

The Software is provided “as-is,” without any warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.

## Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Owner shall not be liable for any damages arising out of or related to the use of the Software, including but not limited to direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages.

## Governing Law

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the Vedic Religion and Owner Authority.

**Vedic Laws**

- That agreement which has been made contrary to the law or to the settled usage of the virtuous, can have no legal force, though it be established by proofs.

## Fine Collection

Fines under this Agreement are denominated in panas, with one pana equal to 3.5 grams of gold at prevailing market value. All fines assessed on the date of violation may be collected directly by the Owner/Brahmana as religiously tax-exempt restitution. All fines assessed for prior dates must be collected exclusively through the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), acting as the designated enforcement and chain-of-custody authorities. Such collection shall ensure full compliance with Vedic Law, federal tax obligations, and the constitutional protections governing lawful restitution.

**Base Fines**

- Perjury through covetousness fined one thousand panas.
- Perjury through distraction fined 100 panas.
- Pergury through fear fine is 500 panas.
- Perjury through friendship the fine is 400 panas.
- Perjury through lust pays ten times the lowest amercement.
- Perjury through wrath three times the middle amercement.
- Perjury through ignorance fine is 100 panas.
- Perjury from childishness the fine is 100 panas.


**Vedic Laws:**

- His peculiar duty is conquest, and he must not turn back in danger; having protected the Vaisyas by his weapons, he may cause the legal tax to be collected;
- As the Sun during eight months (imperceptibly) draws up the water with his rays, even so let him gradually draw his taxes from his kingdom; for that is the office in which he resembles the Sun.
- A trader on reaching a toll-house should pay the legal duty. A prudent man must not try to evade it, (because) it is called the (king's) tax.
- If he evades a toll-house, or if he buys or sells at another than the legal hour, or if he does not state the value (of his goods) correctly, he shall be fined eight times the amount which he tried to evade.
- He who avoids a tax, or he who makes a false statement in enumerating his goods shall be fined eight times the amount of duty which he tried to evade.

## Foundation of Action and Liability

This Agreement is not solely contractual but is spiritually and legally grounded in the Vedic Laws of Action (Karma). All users of the Software are bound not only by secular law but by these principles:

### Action and Consequence
Every act undertaken through mind, speech, or body produces consequence, whether beneficial or harmful. The VLA recognizes that unauthorized use of this Software is not a neutral act but carries spiritual liability as well as legal liability.

### Mental Action
Coveting another’s property, harboring intent to misappropriate, or adherence to false doctrines—including false claims of authorship or ownership of this Software—constitute violations under this Agreement. Such actions incur fines and penalties under the VLA framework.

### Verbal Action
Abusing others, uttering falsehoods, detracting from the merits of lawful work, or engaging in idle and malicious speech—including defamatory statements or false denials of rightful ownership—are breaches of this Agreement and will be treated as enforceable offenses under the VLA.

### Bodily Action
Taking what has not been given, causing injury without sanction, or engaging in unlawful and exploitative acts are declared in Vedic Law to be grave transgressions. Within the VLA, unauthorized access, extraction, reverse engineering, or redistribution of the Software falls under this category and shall be penalized accordingly.

Interpretation:
Under this Agreement, the categories of Mental, Verbal, and Bodily action form legal backbone of enforcement. They ensure that violations are not measured only by technical breach but by the moral weight of the action, with proportional fines and remedies enforced through IRS, FBI, and Owner Authority.

**Vedic Laws:**

- Action, which springs from the mind, from speech, and from the body, produces either good or evil results; by action are caused the (various) conditions of men, the highest, the middling, and the lowest.

- Know that the mind is the instigator here below, even to that (action) which is connected with the body, (and) which is of three kinds, has three locations, and falls under ten heads.

- Coveting the property of others, thinking in one's heart of what is undesirable, and adherence to false (doctrines), are the three kinds of (sinful) mental action.

- Abusing (others, speaking) untruth, detracting from the merits of all men, and talking idly, shall be the four kinds of (evil) verbal action.

- Taking what has not been given, injuring (creatures) without the sanction of the law, and holding criminal intercourse with another man's wife, are declared to be the three kinds of (wicked) bodily action.

## Punishment 

The punishment to be inflicted for it must be proportionate to the heaviness of the crime, so however as not to be less than a hundred (Panas) for Sâhasa of the first degree, whereas for Sâhasa of the middlemost degree the punishment is declared by persons acquainted with the law to be no less than five hundred (Panas). For Sâhasa of the highest degree, a fine amounting to no less than a thousand (Panas) is ordained. Moreover corporal punishment, confiscation of the entire property is declared to be the punishment for Sâhasa of the highest degree.

This gradation of punishments is ordained for every (caste) indiscriminately, excepting only corporal punishment in the case of a Brahman. A Brahman must not be subjected to corporal punishment.

When the thieves are not caught, the king/government must make good the loss from it's own treasury. By showing himself remiss towards criminals, he would incur sin and would offend both against justice and his own interest.

**Vedic Laws:**

- Those who give food or shelter to thieves seeking refuge with them, or who suffer them to escape though able to arrest them, partake of their crime themselves.
- Those who do not come to offer assistance, when people are crying out for help within their hearing, or when property is being taken away, are likewise accomplices in the crime.
- But where justice, wounded by injustice, approaches and the judges do not extract the dart, there they also are wounded by that dart of injustice.
- Either the court must not be entered, or the truth must be spoken; a man who either says nothing or speaks falsely, becomes sinful.
- Where justice is destroyed by injustice, or truth by falsehood, while the judges look on, there they shall also be destroyed.
- Justice, being violated, destroys; justice, being preserved, preserves: therefore justice must not be violated, lest violated justice destroy us.
- One quarter of the guilt of an unjust decision falls on him who committed the crime, one quarter on the false witness, one quarter on all the judges, one quarter on the king/president.
- In the double of that sum which a defendant falsely denies or on which the plaintiff falsely declares, shall those two men offending against justice be fined owed to the Owner.
